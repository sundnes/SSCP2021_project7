## SSCP2021 Mechanics Project (Project 7)

This repository contains example code for Project 7 of the 2021 Suurph Summer School on Computational Physiology. 

### Single cell code for two different cell models:
* Land et al (2017): The model by Land et al (2017), implemented in Python, including code to reproduce (approximately) Figure 6 of the paper.
* Rice et al (2008): Model implemented in Matlab and Python. The Python code also includes scripts that reproduce many of the figures from the paper.

Both models are also included as Gotran (.ode) files. Gotran is a Python-like language for specifying ODEs, and from this code
you can generate model code in a variety of languages and formats, see https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/gotran. The Matlab and
Python code for the models has been generated by Gotran.

### Tissue-level mechanics solvers. 
These are the demos/exercises from the mechanics stream of the summer school, implemented as Python files instead of notebooks.
